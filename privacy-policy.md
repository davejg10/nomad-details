# Privacy Policy for Nomadly

**Last updated: 09/24/2025**

## The Short Version

Nomadly is built with your privacy in mind. We don't collect your personal information, don't require you to create accounts, and don't store your travel itineraries on our servers. Everything you create stays on your device.

## What Information We Collect

### Information We DON'T Collect
- No personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)
- No user accounts or login information
- No travel itineraries or personal content you create
- No location tracking or GPS data
- No photos or personal files

### Information We DO Collect
We only collect technical information to help us improve the app:

**App Performance Data:**
- Crash reports when the app unexpectedly closes
- Basic diagnostic information about app errors
- General performance metrics (like how long the app takes to load)

**App Usage Analytics:**
- Which features you use most often (but not the specific content you create)
- How you navigate through the app
- General usage patterns to help us improve the user experience

**Device Information:**
- A randomly generated device identifier (not linked to your personal identity)
- Basic device information like operating system version
- This helps us ensure the app works properly across different devices

## How We Use This Information

We use the technical data we collect to:
- Fix bugs and crashes
- Improve app performance
- Understand which features are most useful
- Ensure compatibility across different devices

**We never:**
- Sell your information to third parties
- Use your data for advertising
- Share your information with other companies (except our analytics providers)
- Try to identify you personally from this technical data

## Where Your Travel Data is Stored

All your itineraries, saved trips, and personal content are stored **only on your device**. We never see this information and it never leaves your phone.
## Third-Party Services

We use trusted analytics services to help us understand app performance and usage. These services may collect the technical information mentioned above, but they cannot access your personal travel content.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal information about you:
- There's no personal data for you to request or delete
- You can uninstall the app at any time to remove all data from your device
- No account deletion is needed since there are no accounts

## Children's Privacy

Our app doesn't knowingly collect information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal information from anyone, this policy applies to all users regardless of age.

## Changes to This Policy

If we change this privacy policy, we'll update it here and in the app. Since we don't have your contact information, please check back occasionally for updates.

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can contact us at:
- Email: nomadly@nomadly.org

## Legal Compliance

This privacy policy complies with applicable privacy laws including GDPR, CCPA, and Google Play Store requirements. Since we collect minimal technical data and no personal information, most privacy regulations don't apply to our specific use case.
